This repository demonstrates a common error in F# when working with mutable variables and functions. The initial code attempts to swap the values of two mutable variables using a function. However, due to the way F# handles mutability within function scopes, the swap operation doesn't produce the expected result.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach using techniques for proper mutable variable swapping.
